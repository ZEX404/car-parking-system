# Overview
Greetings everyone! I am thrilled to present a snapshot of my enriching internship journey at the Information Technology Institute (ITI), focusing on our remarkable Car Parking System project.Our team achieved significant milestones in this innovative project.

# Key Features

## UART Communication

One of the pivotal aspects of our project involved delving into UART communication. This technology served as the backbone of our system, facilitating seamless communication between the ATmega32 microcontrollers.

## LCD & Keypad Interface
Prioritizing user-friendliness, our team dedicated efforts to interface the LCD display and keypad. This enhancement allows users to effortlessly navigate the system and select their desired parking space.

## Servo Motor Gate
Designing and implementing the servo motor gate posed an exciting challenge. Witnessing its smooth operation, gracefully opening and closing for each vehicle, was truly satisfying.

## Light Sensor
Emphasizing safety, our team integrated a light sensor. This feature ensures that the system adapts to surrounding light conditions, enhancing security, particularly during nighttime.

## Emergency State
Acknowledging potential emergencies, we incorporated an emergency state button feature. This provides a swift solution for urgent situations, demonstrating our commitment to user safety.

## Learning Experience
Participating in this project has been an invaluable learning experience. Beyond the technical aspects of building a car parking system, it has been about fostering teamwork, honing problem-solving skills, and embracing the latest technologies in embedded systems.
